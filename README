============
Introduction
============

  The MultiLanguage Scriptable Development Environment (for short MLSDE) aims
  to be a flexible source editor not engaged to any language.  Right now it is
  in an early development state, so it is not recommended to used in real life.

  Read the documentation found in the '~/docs' directory and see the 'Contact
  info' section to know where you'll find more information.

License

  Read file LICENSE for complete license text.



============
Installation
============

  At the moment, you have to compile the application by yourself.  Sorry.

  You need Lazarus: https://www.lazarus-ide.org/

  Note that sometimes Lazarus removes part of the i18n data (.po files) so I
  recommend to make a backup before to compile to restore it.  Another way is
  to get it from SVN and revert (or compare if you did any change).



===========
Compilation
===========

  First, install Lazarus IDE.  You'll find at http://www.lazarus-ide.org/.

  Then, use Lazarus to open the file '~/src/mlsde.lpi'.  Then compile (may be
  you want to tweak the debug and optimization options first).

  To build source documentation, install pasdoc and execute makedocs.sh.



==========
How to use
==========

  At the moment it doesn't do anything.

  You have more detailed documentation at the "docs" directory.

# Installation #

At the moment, no installation packages are included.  You must compile it by
yourself.

To do so, you must install [Lazarus](https://www.getlazarus.org/) first.

Once installed, open the MLSDE project file (`src/mlsde.lpi`).  Then compile
by selecting the menu option `Run > Compile`.  The executable will be at the
`bin` directory.

Now copy the content of the `bin` directory, including subdirectories, to the
final place.

To open the Configuration Dialog just select `MLSDE > Configuration...` on the
main menu.

You can also press `[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F10]`.

The configuration dialog is divided in two parts:  The _configuration sections_
on the left and the _configuration options_ on the right.

Select the section you want to configure on the left with mouse.  Then change
the options on the right.  Once you finish, click on the `Ok` button at the
bottom to save the changes or `Cancel` to abort them.

Some options need to close and open MLSDE to be effective.  In such cases a
message box will appear.

If you have problems with the configuration, you can reset it by removing the
configuration file at [the user directory](concepts.html#the-directories).

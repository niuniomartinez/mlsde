## Files and Directories ##

This section allows to configure what files and directories will be shown in
the project view.

* **Directory depth**.  This is to select how deep the directory scan will
  work.  A value between `3` and `5` is good most cases.  Do not put a big
  number or it would take too long to scan the project directory.
* **Directory order**.  Allows to change how the directories will be ordered
  in the project tree.
* **Show hidden files**.  If not checked, hidden files will be ignored.
* **Show hidden directories**.  If not checked, hidden directories will be
  ignored.

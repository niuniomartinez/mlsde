# Environment Configuration #

Here you can change how MLSDE looks and works.

![Environment configuration](images/cfg-environment.png)

## Language ##

You can select the language from the drop down.  Best option is `Default (or
English)`.

## Window ##

Here you can select how the main window looks:

+ **Show project name at the beginning of the window title**.  If not check,
  project name will be renderer at the ending of the window title.
+ **Window title shows project path**.  If not check, it won't render the
  project path in the window title.

Next checkbox will select what to show in the main window:

+ **Show menu**.  If not checked the menu bar will be hidden.  In thatcase the
  only way to access to the configuration dialog is by pressing the key
  combination `[Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Esc]`.
+ **Show tool bar**.  If not checked the tool bar will be hidden.
+ **Show status bar**.  If not checked the status bar will be hidden.

Hide all bars to have a clean editor, but right now will not allow to do some
actions.  In a (I hope) near furure you'll be able to access to any action even
with both menu and tool bars hidden thanks to context menues, key combinations
and scripts.

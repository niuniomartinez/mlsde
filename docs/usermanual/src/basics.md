## Configuration ##

Before to start using MLSDE it is recommendable to open the [_Configuration
Dialog_](configuration.html).  To do so select in the top menu `MLSDE >
Configuration...` (this is, the top option of the `MLSDE` menu).

You can select the language for the application.  At the moment there are only
two languages:  English and Spanish.  In most cases you should select `Default
(or English)` as it will select the same language than your operating system
(if available).

Once selected your language click in the `Ok` button.  Maybe a message box
appears telling that you need to restart MLSDE to make the changes effective.
Close it.  Close MLSDE clicking in the _Close Window_ button or `MLSDE > Quit`
in the menu and open MLSDE again:  now it should use the selected language.



## Open Files ##

To open a file you must open a _project_ first.  On MLSDE a project is a
directory.

To open a project you can click on menu `Project > Open...` or click with the
_mouse right button_ in the left part of the window to open the **Project Popup
Menu**.

Also, you can use the `Open project` button from the tool bar.

Select the project directory in the dialog and accept.  The project tree will
appear on the left.  To open a file just do double-click on the file name and
the source editor will appear on the right.

**Pro tip:** You can change the size of the project viewer and the editor by
clicking and dragging the separator between them.



## Edit Files ##

Current version supports very basic edition.  Select text by dragging the mouse
and then use `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+X` and `Ctrl+V` to _copy_, _cut_ and _paste_.

Future versions will include more edition tools and options.

Modified files are marked by an asterisk in the tab.  Modified lines are marked
with a yellow line in the left _gutter_.

# Moved to SourceForge #

I've read that Microsoft has ignored the license terms of various GitHub projects several times, so I decided to remove all the projects I have.

MLSDE has been moved to [sf.net/p/mlsde](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mlsde/).  I know SourceForge has bad reputation but new owners have did a good job cleaning and improving the services.  I was considering to move to GitLab and maybe I'll do in the future as other projects did recently (such as [Lazarus and Free Pascal](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/), for example).

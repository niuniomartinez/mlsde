# MultiLanguage Scriptable Development Environment ##

The **MultiLanguage Scriptable Development Environment** (**MLSDE**) aims to be
a flexible source editor not engaged to any language.  Right now it is in an
early development state, so it is not recommended to used in real life.

Read the documentation found in the '~/docs' directory and see the _Contact
info_ section to know where you'll find more information.

## License ##

Read file `LICENSE` for complete license text.



## Installation ##

At the moment, you have to compile the application by yourself.  Sorry.

You need [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).



## Compilation ##

First, install Lazarus IDE.  You'll find at http://www.lazarus-ide.org/.

Then, use Lazarus to open the file `~/src/mlsde.lpi`.  Then compile (may be
you want to tweak the debug and optimization options first).

To build source documentation, install [pasdoc](https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc)
and execute `makedocs.sh`.



## How to use ##

At the moment it doesn't do anything.

You have more detailed documentation at the `~/docs` directory.
